50,FHIR Core,,,,,,,(methodology),,NEG,Clarification,,,,"FHIR uses many resources to represent either knowledge documents or patient records with each resource having its unique style. For instance, rules and order sets are represented using PlanDefinition whereas a questionnaire is represented with its own separate resource. A patient record appears to be represented using the Person resource but there also exists Composition and DiagnosticReport. Catalog definitions are currently represented using Composition as well though List has also been proposed.  I think it may be a worthwhile exercise at this point to review all of these resources and perhaps consider a more compositional and consistent approach. My suggestion would be to start with Composition which is a fairly general structure consisting of metadata, sections and entries and allow the variation in the expressivity to reside with the choice of metadata structure and entry structures that ultimately define this Composition. For instance, the items in  a questionnaire, the entries in a catalog, the actions in a plan definition, or the statements in a patient record represent different kinds of entries that are part of a composition. This allows all documents, whether definitional or patient-specific to be built on the same core resource.",Use more compositional approach to resource design,Yes,Normative-Substantive,,,,Modeling & Methodology,Not Persuasive,"Composition is intended principally for use with document paradigms.  Its use is not required for FHIR and many FHIR implementations will not make any use of it at all (and should never need to).  Composition is about organization for human consumption and is quite different than PlanDefinition actions or Questionnaire items which serve other purposes.  Person has nothing to do with ""patient record"".  Its purpose is to link multiple roles as being the same individual (e.g. Patient Smith, Dr. Smith, Nurse Smith and Uncle Smith are all the same human being).  Catalogue is still being refined, but the document-approach of organizing information for human consumption makes Composition reasonable.",,,,,,,,,,,Claude Nanjo ,University of Utah ,,cnanjo.mailinglist@gmail.com ,,,,,,
51,FHIR Core,,,,,,,(methodology),,NEG,Clarification,,,,"FHIR can represent collections as either Group, List, or Bundle. The three resources look quite similar in structure and also resemble Composition (they are composed of entries though perhaps make no use of sections). At times it is not clear which resource to use for what. Should the result of a query return Bundle or List? Should a catalog of services be expressed  using Composition or List? Why could a group of entities not be represented as a list rather than as a Group? Much like the previous comment, perhaps collections should take a more compositional approach (i.e., the choice of metadata structure and entry type define the type of collection one wishes to represent) and be based on the same underlying structure (perhaps Composition). It might even be the case that compositions are special types of collections or collections are simple compositions.",Combine collection types,Yes,Normative-Substantive,,Also see #216,,Modeling & Methodology,Not Persuasive,"Each resource behaves very differently.  Bundle is a technical packaging structure used when there's a need to send multiple resources at once.  It's an infrastructure resource.  Group is an entity that can be acted upon or observed (herd of cows, cage of mice, females between 40 and 50, Practice Group 5).  List is a currated collection of clinical items.

52,FHIR Core,,,,,,,(methodology),,NEG,Clarification,,,,"In FHIR, attribution information varies significantly across resources. For instance, in Procedure, when an action was performed is represented as performed[x]. For medication administration, the performance time is represented as effective[x]. In communication, it is represented using the attribute 'sent'. Information about the performer is also represented fairly heterogeneously. For instance, in Procedure it is captured with the structure Performer which contains role, actor, and on behalf of. In MedicationAdministration, there is also a performer structure but it lacks role. In Communication, there is a 'sender' even though it is also an action which could be performed by a role, onBehalfOf. In Procedure, there is a location field which is missing for MedicationAdministration and Communication. In order to ensure better cross-resource consistency, I would strongly recommend that FHIR consider an attribution model or discusses the attribution model currently considered by the CIMI group and align on a consistent approach for representing this information. This lack of consistency will impose a cost on implementers who will need to define different transformations for each resource when such variability does not confer significant benefits.",Introduce an attribution model for FHIR,Yes,Normative-Substantive,,See also #214,,Modeling & Methodology,Not Persuasive,"FHIR has instituted patterns such as the Request, Event and Definition patterns to encourage consistency in naming.  However, domain requirements and alignment with domain terminology trump the need for consistency.

Patient.gender

Definition 
Administrative Gender - the gender that the patient is considered to have for administration and record keeping purposes.

Requirements 
Needed for identification of the individual, in combination with (at least) name and birth date. Gender of individual drives many clinical processes.
 
Comments 
The gender might not match the biological sex as determined by genetics, or the individual's preferred identification. Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F. Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosonal, social, etc.) However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice. Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosonal and other gender aspects. For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overrideable error, not a ""hard"" error.

215,FHIR Core,,,,,,Condition,,,NEG,Correction,,,,"Condition.clinicalStatus should not be a limited to a code from the condition-code value set. Why?
(1) If Condition really can be used to represent a concern, as its definition states, we expect it to support cases such as ""can't pay for medication"" and ""potentially abusive environment,"" which don't have clinical status values. The purpose of this property seem to indicate whether the item is ""of concern"" or ""not of concern,"" thereby supporting application decisions regarding when to display the content. ""Of concern"" may subsume states that are asymptomatic, which might be classified as ""inactive"" from a physiological perspective.
(2) The state of the disorder may be a fine-grained clinical concept, possibly specific to the disorder, including not only ""well-controlled"" and ""remission,"" but also ""latent,"" ""sub-clinical,"" ""symptomatic,"" or any number of domain-specific values. These clinical values should be given an value set that depends on the specific Condition.
Recommend approach is to separate into two attributes:
1. concernStatus: codeableConcept, few values (e.g., active & inactive)
2. clinicalStatus: codeableConcept, many values
It may be possible to infer an appropriate concernStatus from a clinicalStatus, given some set of contextual assumptions.

Current FHIR list: 
active - ambiguous. Symptomatic, or Of concern?
recurrence - possibly orthogonal to state axis; difficult to distinguish from relapse
relapse - possibly orthogonal to state axis; difficult to distinguish from recurrence
well-controlled - clinically precise but disorder-specific
poorly-controlled - clinically precise but disorder-specific

Do we really feel that it is useful to include Patient.animal as a part of the base spec?  That is a modifier element, and in practice, I expect nearly all (human-centric) implementations will ignore the fact that it is a modifier, and thus not strictly be spec-compliant.  If everyone is going to intuitively do the wrong thing per the spec, that seems like a problem with the spec.   My suggestion is to remove Patient.animal from the core spec and make it standard extension.

Determine the legally responsible PHA(s);

Current State
To date, eCR has been advanced using a centralized rule-based decision support approach for managing the complex business logic associated with jurisdictional reporting rules. The centralized approach has been used to address the difficulties in distributing and implementing complex business rules in EHRs. The decision support rules are complex for several reasons: 
1. The rules logic for determining reportable conditions usually involves the evaluation of laboratory results and may include complex logic, such as logic dependent on age, multiple clinical findings, immunization history, or other criteria. 
2. The criteria for a given condition may differ by jurisdiction, and may differ over time within a jurisdiction. Each State and Territorial (and many Local) Public Health Agency is governed by different reporting laws, and the sensitivity and specificity of criteria used in the logic may differ depending on the jurisdiction’s laws and goals/priorities for disease monitoring. 
3. The conditions under surveillance differ by jurisdiction. Most jurisdictions require reporting of conditions related to the 74 conditions under national surveillance by the CDC, but most (if not all) PHAs also require other conditions to be reported. Over 200 unique conditions may be required to be reported across all jurisdictions.  

The rule-based approach follows the ‘Event-Condition-Action’ paradigm: when the event has been detected (i.e. using trigger codes), evaluate the condition(s) of the logic (i.e., run the ‘IF…THEN’ rules), and if the condition is satisfied, execute the action (i.e., communicate reportability status to inform reporting actions).  Note that the term ‘condition’ here is referring to conditional rules, not the reportable ‘condition’ itself. 

The first stage of the process requires the identification of events in the patient’s electronic health record (EHR) to trigger decision support. This preliminary identification currently uses “flat” trigger code value sets provisioned in a spreadsheet that EHR vendors / clinical care personnel download and use to match against certain EHR data types: diagnoses, problems, lab test names, lab result values, lab orders, or medications. The current trigger codes focus on diagnoses, problems, condition-specific lab test names, organisms and substances found in condition-specific lab results associated with non-specific test methods (e.g., general culture tests), lab orders for conditions reportable upon suspicion, and a limited set of condition-specific medications.  To simplify EHR tasks, triggering occurs based on a single event. Thus, in the case of laboratory results, triggering occurs based on selected lab test names (LOINC codes); decision support is required to evaluate for ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ results and other requirements for reportability. 

Preliminary identification of an event initiates creation of an eICR, which summarizes the EHR data that will be used as  input for secondary assessment using decision support.   

The secondary assessment stage of the process requires evaluation of the summarized data by a Decision Support engine to:
• Determine the legally responsible PHA(s) based on the patient’s residence and where care was delivered;
• Apply public health agency-specific logic to determine if the data indicates the presence of a condition that is reportable to the legally responsible PHAs; This step involves evaluation of laboratory results and other logic that may be simple or complex. 
• Generate the determination of reportability in an output file;
This second stage is currently oriented to implementation on a common, shared services platform where decision support is required to determine the reportablity of the information included in the summary of EHR data in the eICR. The output of the decision support is required to determine whether to forward the eICR as a ‘case report’ document for public health reporting. In general, PHA’s only want PII data that closely aligns with their reporting laws.

While the event identification function that occurs using trigger codes aligns well with reporting logic that requires only one concept be matched to meet a reporting rule, there are several reasons processing through a decision support engine is required before transmitting PII data to a PHA. First, the trigger code set includes condition-specific codes for all reportable events in the US, and therefore a match may not be against codes that are applicable to  relevant jurisdiction. Second, many conditions include logic that requires two or more concepts to be processed to determine reportablity (particularly, laboratory results where the result value is used in combination with the test name). Third, the specific logic for reporting conditions may vary by PHA and be adjusted during outbreaks to facilitate earlier identification of a case. ","the description of the current state was incomplete and sometimes not correct. I have proposed changes based on the current descriptions used for the digital bridge efforts and current state of RCKMS.  

here are some specific notes of changes I made:

'change 'data type' to 'data element'.  Isn't data type referring to date or string, etc.  

Replace 'Lab results' with 'lab test names, lab result values'.  I recommend this because 'lab results' is a complex clinical model that includes several 'data elements'.  we should be precise about the fields used to match the data. 

replace '-for suspect cases' with 'or lab orders when reporting is required upon suspicion of a reportable condition).'  It is not a 'case' until it has been investigated by the health department.  I am providing more clear language.

the 'trigger codes' are used to identify events, they are NOT on their own to be used to identify reportable events. Trigger codes are NOT equivalent to 'a reasonable suspicion'.  

I have enhanced the text to correct the information that should be shared. 

added: 'and a limited set of condition-specific medications' in order to be complete.  Will be true for TB and a couple of other conditions.

Are there opportunities to incrementally advance some business rules (like only – positive lab results, or location specific reporting) before broad capabilities are available?","I believe that laboratories should be required to improve the standardization of the results they return to EHRs in order to support decision support and data aggregation and reporting both for clinical care and public health uses.  For example, laboratories could be calculating results relative to normal and critical ranges and standardizing the findings related to organisms.  In parallel, the standards for summarizing lab data need to be enhanced to pull in all the data included in lab reports (e.g., specimen info).  Advances on these fronts are critical for moving forward with simplifying the logic required to process laboratory results. These advances will drive incremental advancement for DS on several fronts. If the EHR systems could easily identify positive results without requireing decision support, then it would simplify some of the logic that is currently required by the secondary assessment currently implemented in RCKMS.   

If identifying 'positive' lab results without DS is feasible, then it may be possible to move forward with simpler rules for diagnoses and lab results that are currently required in RCKMS.  There are many conditions though that have rules that require additional criteria beyond the lab and diagnositic criteria (e.g., age, symptom, immunization history, radiology, etc) or that require combinations of diagnsotic and lab criteria.  These reporting rules require DS logic.  Therefore, there will be an ongoing need for DS.  

While there are opportunities to incrementally advance rules, it will be important to ensure that the conditions selected can be addressed using the functionality available.  It will be a problem if expectations are set that reporting can be automated but the suite of rules required to identify the reportable conditions are not implemented. In this scenario, PHAs won't get all the reports needed and may recieve reports they are not supposed to receive.  We recommend starting with a set of conditions that are reportable across the nation, and that are based on only simple logic including diagnoses and laboratory findings.

EHR vendors have indicated that they would like a common set of trigger codes. 

a- Are there specific needs that State and Local PHAs have for 1) creating additional trigger codes and 2) managing their own reporting rules?

b- How could rules be structured so that there could be reporting to the PHAs of the patient’s residence wherever that may be nationally (vs. the location that care was provided) be enabled?

c- There is currently a single set of Trigger codes that is produced from PHA rules input into the shared public health decision support system (Reportable Condition Knowledge Management System) on the shared services platform. These trigger codes do not necessarily need to be used with RCKMS. Does this approach adequately capture trigger codes needed by public health agencies for reporting?","
answer to 5a- they will only need their own trigger codes if they have rules that are not included in the rules logic implemented. It will be really important that RCKMS is supported to be a usable and sustainable system that allows PHAs to author and manage their rules.  The goal should be to support their needs so the centralized resource can be used to either be available centrally or as the knowledge resource to implement the other strategies (i.e., output CQL or distribute locally). 

answer to 5b. the decision support must include rules for all juriscitions where a patient may reside, not just the rules for the jurisdicaiton where care is provided.  the patient address info can trigger the rules for the appropriate jurisdiction.  this is what is currently occuring for RCKMS on the AIMS platform. 

answer to 5c. the trigger codes are based on the value sets used in the reporting logic defined by the public health agencies. The issue of the adequacy of the codes comes down to whether or not the concepts and thus code sets that are included in the the logic are complete for representing the logic desired by a public health agency. There is a need to get all the logic into RCKMS and a need for PHA's to maintain their logic. There is a 'start up' phase that needs to be acknowledged, and there is a need to support the project.  If the system is not supported centrally, then the EHR systems will need to manage code sets coming from multiple different PHAs.

In non-FHIR EHR implementations and CDA document exchange, the time/date of initiation and the end of clinical encounters have had variable implementation and availability. FHIR has specific data variables for both. 
a- Will these data be more consistently implemented in FHIR for decision support use?

b- How can FHIR be used to initiate an eICR in close proximity to the start of an encounter, while still including a reasonable amount of initial data?

c- Assuming that decision support can be close to immediate and recognizing that charting practices differ in different clinical environments, will it be useful to de-couple the delivery of public health information for a reportable condition from the actual first reporting of that condition (that will have adequate data)?

d- For encounters where a condition has been identified and reported, it make sense to separate next-step reporting for an encounter into reporting on newly identified conditions and reporting on the already identified condition:

e- When a new condition is identified sometime after the start of an encounter, does it make sense to delay reporting on that new condition so as to collect information as above, or because it is later in the encounter should the reporting of a new condition be immediate?

In FHIR, will it be possible to maintain information about conditions that have already been reported for an encounter? If so, in what timeframe should update / replacement eICRs be transmitted?

Should a final eICR be sent at some point after the end of an encounter so as to include all data that were available for that encounter? Is there an approach to setting a transmission for some time or event post-encounter to do so?","answers: 

answers to b and c- This likely needs real world input such as from the digital bridge pilots, but I would expect that the answer is dependent on the condition.  It is important to note that if the DS logic doing the secondary assessment determines that a reportable condition exists, then that may be enough for a PHA to initiate an investigation for some conditions (eg. measles, pertussis, etc).  They would not want to wait.  for other conditions, it is acceptable to wait.  the 'reporting time frame' for the condition could be used to differentiate those scenerios when immediate reporting should occur and when waiting until later in the encounter would be okay.  I think that is the data field that would be required to drive the decision support.    

answer to e- If it is a new condition, then it should be handled the same way you handle any condition. it should not be dependent of when it was identified relative to the encounter.  The timing of the reporting should be dependent on the urgency with which public health needs the information to drive action.

There are use cases within an Electronic Case Reporting workflow where using FHIR is appropriate. However, we should not recreate the wheel in situations where there are existing standards that better fit the use case. For situations like the Initial Case Report, using the existing CCDA format is more appropriate for that workflow and use case and we do not want to create unnecessary burden on implementers to have to support multiple standards just for the sake of FHIR. Instead, we would encourage this project to focus on areas of the workflow where we do think FHIR would help the Public Health and Healthcare Providers complete their workflows.

In addition, there are reference implementations available that support the use of CDS Hooks to evaluate CQL-based knowledge artifacts, and many of the major EHR vendors have stated support for implementing CDS Hooks, so even if an EHR doesn't provide native support for CQL evaluation, a CDS Hooks integration would make the possibility available.",API question response - No summary was provided by the commenter.,,,,,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bryn Rhodes ,"ESAC, Inc.

1,QI Core,,,,,,,(profiles),,A-S,Clarification,,,,One detected Issue message I didn’t see was something that may be needed when screening was not actually completed due to a lack of a variable.  The clinician could mistakenly think screening took place and there was no problem found. An example may be where a patient’s dosing wasn’t screened because we may have their age but not weight  - this could happen in an ED where the patient is unconscious or in a retail pharmacy where weight isn’t typically recorded. The pharmacist may input a high dose for a pediatric patient but never receive an alert because weight wasn’t present. I will make a comment to that affect but otherwise found the detected issues to be good.,**website comment**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bonnie Briggs ,Wolters Kluwer Health ,,bonnie.briggs@wolterskluwer.com ,,,,,,
2,QI Core,,,,,,,(profiles),,A-S,Clarification,,,,"o Should QICore comment on ClinicalReasoning resources, such as GuidanceResponse and PlanDefinition?  Perhaps profiles do not make sense because they are not part of QUICK, but it seems like QICore should provide implementors at least some guidance on how ClinicalReasoning relates, since it is also focused on decision support and quality measures.
o I do not understand why an element where MustSupport is false could not be used for triggering a CDS action if it's available.  A more detailed example of why this is the case might help.
o Why require a CDS service to support a profile if the resource has no relevence to type of decision support being provided?  Do all CDS services need to support QICore-Claim?",**website comment**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mark Cacciapouti ,Wolters Kluwer Health ,,mark.cacciapouti@wolterskluwer.com ,,,,,,

The initial phase of a sequencing run produces raw sequence with a qualification of the quality of the raw sequence. The raw sequence is then subject to further computational analysis. In traditional sequencing the product is a single 'read' and the initial step is often the final step. However, in techniques such as next-generation sequencing, the initial step is massively parallel and many 'reads' result. The next phase for massively parallel sequencing techniques is to align the 'reads' to each other and a reference sequence, which acts as a scaffold to aid in assembling 'reads,' in order to create longer, contiguous series of sequences. The next phase for traditional and highly-parallel sequencing techniques is to compare the sequence, or sequence of the assembled 'reads,' to a reference sequence.

This comment is described in detail within separate ballot comments, enclosed below in short for convenience. The term finding in the DiagnosticReport genetics profile appears in the UML diagrams from the beginning of the IG but is not defined until section “1.2.3 Genetic Findings” where it’s described as “the fine and coarse-grained descriptions of a specimen's genetic characteristics”. However, this description means that genetics findings are in fact the genetics observations referred from this profile. So why introduce a new term if it’s identical to observation? On the other hand, in some texts like “For example, an interpretation asserting that ‘deletions or duplications were found’ might be supported by observations of variants that contain deletions and/or duplications”, it’s unclear what’s the real difference between interpretation and observation, let alone finding. Therefore, aligned with the general comment summarized below, it is proposed that genetics findings are what is assigned to the DiagnosticReport conclusion and codedDiagnosis attributes (whose names are proposed in the general ballot comment to be replaced with finding and codedFinding respectively).

General comment on finding (short version of MAY2018 ballot comment on DiagnosticReport): The term ‘finding’ is ambiguous across FHIR resources, in particular as described /mentioned in the FHIR Observation, DiagnosticReport and Condition resources. For example, the DiagnosticReport description starts with “The findings and interpretation of diagnostic tests” but it’s unclear whether findings refer to the referenced result observations or to the codedDiagnosis (in which the included term ‘diagnosis’ seems more advanced along the clinical methodology than just finding). The Condition resource description has one example that equates finding with diagnosis however it’s mostly about capturing problems, disorders/disease, etc. In Observation, finding is mentioned in one of the code/value pair patterns. In SNOMED CT, there are two top-level hierarchies of ‘Clinical finding’ and ‘Observable Entity’ and a few attributes of the aforementioned resources are bound to those hierarchies, but not always aligned with the resource main scope. It is proposed to have DiagnosticReport as the main placeholder for findings and rename its conclusion attributes.

Each of these study tests is represented by a genetics diagnostic report profile where its conclusion/codedDiagnosis represent the interpretation of that test.

This would allow saying ""this variant is associated with an increase risk of cardiovascular disease"" rather than ""based on this variant, the patient is at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease"", which isn't necessarily a determination the reporting organization may wish to assert. Feedback is welcome.",,"This is an area we’ve discussed in the course of developing the CG v3 specs. Consider for example the information included in a paper curated in the following OMIM Entry: 

“Despite the dramatic responses to EGFR inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, most patients ultimately have a relapse. {12:Kobayashi et al. (2005)} reported a patient with EGFR-mutant, Gefitinib-responsive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had a relapse after 2 years of complete remission during treatment with Gefitinib. The DNA sequence of the EGFR gene in his tumor biopsy specimen at relapse revealed the presence of a second mutation ({131550.0006}). Structural modeling and biochemical studies showed that this second mutation led to the Gefitinib resistance.”

At the time when the “second mutation” was revealed, there’s a basis to assert that the first mutation led to the situation of the patient being Gefitinib-responsive. At this point in time, what should be the nature of the association of the first versus the second mutation to the responsiveness to Gefitinib? I would argue the first association is sort of retrospective and can be asserted with more certainty to that specific patient, while the second association could be seen as linking to knowledge.

These issues should be discussed in a broader sense, that is, broader than genetic testing scenarios, rather - the future state of a longitudinal health record of the patient where we expect the ‘dots to be connected’ as much as possible, surfacing up insights from a broader perspective along the various dimensions of time, content and types of data.",knowledge representation,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amnon Shabo (Shvo) ,Philips ,,,,,,,,

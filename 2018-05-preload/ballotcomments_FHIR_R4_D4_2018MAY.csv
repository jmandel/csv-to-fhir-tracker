1	FHIR Core						DiagnosticReport		http://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/diagnosticreport.html 	NEG	Enhancement		"conclusion, codedDiagnosis (attribute names)"	"finding, codedFinding  (new attribute names)"	"The term ‘finding’ is ambiguous across FHIR resources, as follows. 

The DiagnosticReport description starts with “The findings and interpretation of diagnostic tests” but it’s unclear whether findings refer to the result attribute’s referenced observations or to the conclusion & codedDiagnosis attributes. Furthermore, in the attribute name ‘codedDiagnosis’, the included term ‘diagnosis’ seems more advanced on the clinical reasoning process than just finding or (interpretation), so it's somewhat inconsistent with the above description.
 
Diagnosis in turn is typically captured by the Condition resource, however, in the Condition description, finding is also mentioned in one of the examples where it is equated with diagnosis: “It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis)”. However, the essence of Condition seems to be more on problems, disorders, diseases, etc., per the resource description and most of the examples included there. 

In the Observation resource, the finding concept is mentioned for the first time in section 10.1.4.4.3 (Interoperability Issues using code value pairs in FHIR), but is not defined nor clrearly distinguished from the concept of observation itself. In one of the patterns suggesting to bind the code attribute to the SNOMED CD terms with semantic type of clinical finding (a SNOMED top level hierarchy), the spec seems to be blurring the distinction between findings and observable information items like those defined by another SNOMED top level hierarchy of ‘Observable entity’ (Code 363787002).

Thus, finding seems to be an elusive concept and is so perhaps due to being the intermediate level of conclusion, somewhere between discrete observation’s interpretation and a more established diagnosis, captured in a Condition resource. For example, several abnormal ECG observations may be associated with a suspected atrial fibrillation finding, but to establish a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation diagnosis, there got to be a few of such findings appeared in specific certainty, order and timing, etc, as defined in clinical guidelines. 

The DiagnosticReport.codedDiagnosis is bound to SNOMED Clinical finding hierarchy (the same as in one of the aforementioned Observation code-value pair patterns), but in DiagnosticReport the binding is at the spec level itself, and thus seems more substantial to this resource. Therefore, it is proposed that the DiagnosticReport resource will be described as the main placeholder to capture the concept of finding in a more explicit way. To this end, the ballot proposal is add description and calrity in this spirit, and to rename the conclusion and codedDiagnosis attributes to finding and codedFinding respectively, so that they reflect the finding ‘nature’ of DiagnosticReport backbone (i.e., code, results and conclusion). 

In this way, the distinction between the terms of observation, finding and condition will be made clearer, at least within the scope of DiagnosticReport. To complete this change, there got to be more clarity in Observation and Condition about finding, and that might be submitted in separate ballot comments, however, if this ballot comment is found persuasive, then DiagnosticReport will become the focal point of findings."

The concept of any condition that is followed over time pending a diagnosis will be helpful in gathering evidence for index cases, case reports and establishiing a diagnosis (the history of HIV/AIDS is a good example) where having established codes that can be searched may reveal a trend of ""conditions"" that heralds an emerging disease or disease entity "		Yes																		Greg Staudenmaier  	US Department of Veterans Affairs 	Keith Salzman 	keith.salzman@bookzurman.com

131	FHIR Core						EntryDefinition			NEG	Correction				"This resource should not exist.  ""Wrappers"" are not allowed in FHIR.  Every resource must stand alone and be interpretable and processable without access to referenced resources.  As well, identifiers, classifications, relationships, etc. belong with the item, not as part of a catalogue.  A catalogue can group items, but can't change their characteristics.  A medication in a catalog is a medication instance and all information about that catalogue item belongs on the Medication instance itself - the Medication instance might be catalogue-specific."	Drop EntryDefinition	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
132	FHIR Core						"ProcessRequest, ProcessResponse"			NEG					"These resources overlap in functionality with Task and with standard RESTful query capabilities.  Cancel is a type of task.  A request to cancel a prescription, lab order or to initiate discharge proceedings for an Encounter would be handled as a Task.  Cancelling a Claim or other financial event should be no different.  Requesting re-processing (re-execution of an operation) can also be performed using Task.  Where business processing has been requested, Task represents that fulfillment process and can thus convey the business state of execution.  As such ""status"" is inappropriate either - just query for the Task associated with processing the request - as is done for all other workflows.  Finally, polling is a type of query and should use either the RESTful query mechanism or an operation, not a resource."	ProcessRequest/ProcessResponse should not exist	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
133	FHIR Core						DeviceComponent			NEG					It's not clear why separating DeviceComponent from Device is necessary.

Fold DeviceComponent into Device																			Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
134	FHIR Core						OccupationalData			NEG	Correction				"OccupationalData is a collection of Observations.  It is part of a family of several hundred or more similar types of data where a collection of questions related to a particular topic are gathered and passed around as a group.  Other examples include prenatal records, nursing charts, etc.  FHIR *cannot* have separate resources for each of these areas.  The needs will need to be met through some combination of questionnaires, logical models and mapping of data to other resources - principly Observations.  (As a note, this information has historically been captured in most systems as observations.)"	OccupationalData should not exist as a resource	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
135	FHIR Core						VisionPrescription			NEG	Correction				"Everything in VisionPrescription can now be adequately expressed using DeviceRequest.  Orders for eyeglasses are no more special than orders for prosthetics, wheelchairs or other parameterized devices - and we're not going to have separate resources for each category of device.  As such, VisionPrescription should be withdrawn and replaced with a profile on DeviceRequest"	Drop VisionPrescription in favor of parameterized DeviceRequest	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
136	FHIR Core						"EligibilityRequest, EligibilityResponse, EnrolmentRequest, EnrollmentResponse"			NEG	Correction				"EligibilityRequest is either too broadly named or too narrowly defined.  There are numerous processes in healthcare that involve checking for eligibility and enrollment processes, including clinical trials, monitoring programs, group therapy sessions, etc.  The resources should either be generalized to allow these other uses, or should be named specific to Coverage (e.g. CoverageEligibilityRequest).  Please engate with PatientCare and OO to evaluate the appropriateness of generalizing these resources."	Generalize or rename Eligibility and Enrollment resources	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
137	FHIR Core						"EligibilityResponse, EnrollmentResponse, ClaimResponse"			NEG	Correction				"All FHIR resources that are intended to be persisted must be able to be usefully interpreted and actioned on a stand-alone basis without other resources being available.  For example, a ""pre-determination"" or ""pre-authorization"" might be sent to a downstream system to support an eventual claim or a payor might wish to provide an un-requested pre-authorization for a service it had algorithmically determined was appropriate/needed.  Whether this is current practice or not, ""event"" resources should never pre-suppose the existence of a request.  The only exception in FHIR is non-persisted (throw-away) responses to operations such as OperationOutcomes or Parameters."	Response' doesn't allow for resources to stand alone	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
138	FHIR Core						GuidanceResponse			NEG	Correction				"FHIR resources that are intended to be persisted must be able to stand alone without any access to any referenced resources.  As defined, a GuidanceResponse cannot be intepreted independently of the definition of the decision support service the call was made to.  That's ok if GuidanceResponse acts like a Parameters resource which is never persisted and simply wraps the information (contraindications, recommended orders, etc.) coming back from the decision support engine.  If so, this should be clarified (and it should be explained why GuidanceResponse isn't just a profile on Parameters).  If not, then enough information needs to be included in GuidanceResponse that it could be passed alone to a downstream system and that system would be able to understand and act on the CDS recommendation."	GuidanceResponse is problematic as a stand-alone resource	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
139	FHIR Core						MedicinalProductClinicals			NEG	Correction				"This is collecting a bunch of pieces of knowedge, each of which should be an independent statement with its own status.  Interactions, side effects, indications are all ""knowledge"" statements that might be made asserted by some domain expert with an assertion of level of evidence, authority source, etc.  And such statements can be made about a variety of therapies and interventions.  This needs to be decomposed (and perhaps collapsed into a single knowledge resource) with discussion with the CDS work group.  Having a collection resource like this with this level of specificity is not viable for FHIR."

140	FHIR Core						"MedicinalProductClinicals,  MedicinalProductDeviceSpec, MedicinalProductPharmaceutical  "			NEG	Correction				"The number of proposed MedicinalProduct/Substance resources is non-sustainable As part of the alignment with the MedicationKnowledge pattern, effort should be made to collapse many of these resources into a single resource that can be profiled to meet the project requirements.  As well, information such as manufacturing details, regulatory approval, etc. might be split off into resources that can be stated generaicly about all types of products, not something specific to medications."	Collapse MedicinalProduct/Substance definition resources	Yes																		Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
141	FHIR Core		2.45				"Substance, Medication, Device"			NEG	Correction				"This smacks of data modeling over implementer practice.  Resources need to reflect what implementers *do*, not what we believe they ""should"" do.  Lot number, etc. live on the Device or Medication resource and can't be maintained independently.  (As well, nothing here actually says what the instance is, no explains how it relates to Patient."	Drop ItemInstance																			Melva Peters 	HL7 Canada 	Lloyd McKenzie 	lmckenzie@gevityinc.com 				
142	FHIR Core							(many)		NEG	Correction				"All canonical declarations should be qualified in a similar manner to Reference.  For example ElementDefinition.type.profile should be canonical(StructureDefinition,ImplementationGuide), not just canonical.  The only time canonical should appear alone is if the intention is that all knowledge/structure resources are considered valid targets."

"	"in addition to the get based search method above, servers that support search SHOULD also support a POST based search:

"	"As the owner/oparator of Provincial EHR assets, the development, testing, and rollout of both GET and POST service functionality in a high-complexity integrated environment is very resource-intensive. When working with known integration partners and client users, it is easy to negotiate support for just GET or POST, and not necessarily both. Anecdotally, we have three FHIR-capable Provincial EHR Assets in production that only require HTTP GET for search (with more on the way). There have been no client requests for support of HTTP POST for Search, and thus no meaningful justification for the cost to implement a POST service for each of those assets, aside from being deemed ""FHIR-Conformant""."

The statement “that large […] values are extremely rare in medicine” is due to a human-centric representation of values; this is opposed to a machine-centric representation or scientific representation. The machine-centric representation would benefit from a more canonical representation. This would ease machine learning and artificial intelligence uses for the data by allowing for the representation with common units rather than having to convert between representation of values in various units selected specifically to maintain  a number of precision digits . Consistent use of canonical units (SI units and derived units) and scientific notation would simplify machine interpretation.

Is it required that different search pages will have different timestamps? Isn't this determined by implementation? (e.g. If I perform the entire query on the first search, and only return it one page at a time, I'd thing that the timestamp would be the initial query.)

REST is good for reading, and simple updates, but for more complex tasks we should be emphasizing operations.

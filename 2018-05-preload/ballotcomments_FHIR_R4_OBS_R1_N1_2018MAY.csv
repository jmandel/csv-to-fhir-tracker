1,FMG,,10.1.4.4.3,,,,Observation,,http://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/observation.html,NEG,Clarification,,finding,"Either better define the concept of finding in the context of observation, or remove the use of finding in the Observation description. Also, replace the suggested binding to SNOMED Clinical finding hierarchy with Observable entity, or remove this binding.","This comment is related to my comment on DiagnosticReport within this ballot cycle and should be considered in light of the latter.

The term ‘finding’ is ambiguous across FHIR resources, specifically in DiagnosticReport, but also in Condition and Observation. 
In the Observation resource, the finding concept is mentioned for the first time in section 10.1.4.4.3 (Interoperability Issues using code value pairs in FHIR), but is not defined or clearly distinguished from the concept of observation. One of the patterns mentioned in this section, provides guidance to bind the code attribute to the SNOMED CD terms with semantic type of clinical finding (a SNOMED top level hierarchy 404684003) – the same binding as of DiagnosticReport.codedDiagnosis. Therefore, the spec seems to be blurring the distinction between findings and observable information items like those defined by SNOMED top level hierarchy of ‘Observable entity’ (Code 363787002).

The example given across the four patterns is abdominal tenderness. This is a rather subjective observation done by clinicians typically a part of a physical examination and based on symptoms presented by the patient. It seems less of a finding in the sense of being a result of some clinical reasoning that suggests possible underlying issues, possibly substantiated by other observations.

In this regard, consider also the last section in Wikipedia on “Medical finding” (though this is unclear either):
“Findings and symptoms
Although the difference is not clear in everyday parlance, medical findings and symptoms are completely delineated: during the process of confirming a medical finding the empirical character (those that can be found) of the collected medical characteristics is brought out, highlighting symptom of an affliction.”

2,FMG,,,,,,Observation,,http://build.fhir.org/valueset-observation-category.html,NEG,,16171,,,"I would like to request a few additional codes for the Observation.category. There are three situations I would like to see; (1) Test data, (2) Demo data, (3) calibration data.  All three of these Observation reports could look identical to real physiological data and without some means of distinguishing 'fake data' from 'real data' there would be no way for a reader application to know. The amount of test data and demo data is probably unusually high right now due to all the testing going on.

Nevertheless, the results of a study grabbing all vital signs measurements (one reason for having the LOINC vital signs magic codes) could be seriously comprimized if it includes the 'fake' data along with the real data. Adding these codes would solve this potentially serious problem.",,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brian Reinhold1 ,Philips ,,,,,,,,

","Comment: When using this element, an observation will typically have either a value or a set of related resources, although both may be present as is the case with the personal helth devices. ","As part of the Continua Design guidelines, we are using the observation.related element to reference a Conincident time stamp (The information in the coincident time stamp Observation is used to correct the time stamps such that they are on the same time line as the PHG ) and to reference another metric object which is related in a way to the current one. In any case the Observation resource contains value element. Now, introducing two new elements: .hasMember and .derivedFrom to replace the .related element, we have to use the .hasMember element when the value is always present.
In our view the referenced Observation could be better modelled by using the ""Qualified-by"" relationship type, and since the Coincident time stamp observation will be referenced by many vital sign observations using the .hasMember may be confusing. Also here ""Qualified-by"" would be a better choice for the relationship type. If we have to choose between .hasMember and .derivedFrom we will pick .hasMember.

HL7 v2.8 supports both numerical array (NA) and multiplexed arrays. It is not clear how this is supported in FHIR. This sort of data is good for capturing information over time and other dimensions whose primary factors are in common. (There may be a way of doing this through multiple resource instances, but that could cause significant overhead in high frequency measurements.). It is possible that a numeric array may be addressed as described in 10.1.4.3.2 Observation.component, but that is not clear, not does it seem to address multiplexed arrays.

6,FHIR Core,,,,,,Observation,,http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/observation.html#refine,NEG,Clarification,,"If possible, use the most specific code you can

e.g.: Observation.code = 49134-0 Glucose [Mass/?volume] in Blood 2 hours post dose glucose

Alternatively, use code translations in Observation.code.

e.g.: Observation.code = coding-1: 20564-1 Oxygen saturation in Blood, coding-2: 59408-5 Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry

Another alternative is to use the precondition extension.

e.g.:

Observation.code = 20564-1 Oxygen saturation in Blood, Observation.value: 98%

observation-precondition extension: Observation.code: 19995-0 Oxygen/Inspired gas Respiratory system by O2 Analyzer on ventilator Observation.value: 100%","1. Use a specific code, if one is available, but always provide a more general (e.g., methodless) code if available to support broader intelligibility. Include both in the coding list.
e.g., for Observation.code = 49134-0 Glucose [Mass/?volume] in Blood 2 hours post dose glucose
	make sure to include 2345-7 Glucose [Mass/​volume] in Serum or Plasma
2. Use a component for observations that cannot stand alone
	example: taken while patient was lying down (?)
3. Use a precondition for observations that can stand alone
	example: 19995-0 Oxygen/Inspired gas Respiratory system by O2 Analyzer on ventilator","a. recommend #2, not #1. #1 (""If possible, use the most specific code you can"") is contrary to LOINC direction to decompose method.
b. use the same example for both points - glucose or O2.
c. GForge recommends component for dependent observation, extension for independent. This language did not make it into the spec, but it's a good question and should be addressed.

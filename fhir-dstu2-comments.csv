EGFR Gene, Mutation Analysis, Tumor
RECEIVED: 06/11/2013 12:04 REPORTED: 06/11/2013 17:05
Specimen Tissue-Tumor MCR
Specimen ID 1062170 MCR
Order Date 11 Jun 2013 13:12 MCR
Reason for Referral MCR
 Evaluate tumor DNA for presence of a mutation in exons 18-21
 of the EGFR gene.
Method MCR
 Microscopic examination was performed by a pathologist to
 identify areas of tumor for enrichment by macro dissection.
 A PCR based assay employing allele specific amplification
 was used to test for the presence of 
21666-3  EGFR gene mutations tested for  29 mutations within  exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene (G719A, G719S, G719C in exon
 18; small deletions in exon 19; T790M, S768I, and small
 insertions in exon 20; and L858R and L861Q in exon 21).
 Mutation nomenclature is based on GenBank accession number;
48013-7  Genomic reference sequence NM005228.3. (This may not be the right format which I think would be NM_005228.3 
Result MCR
 Tumor type: Lung Adenocarcinoma
-
21665-5  EGFR gene mutations found EGFR status: Wild-type
Interpretation MCR
 THIS IS REALLY BOILER PLATE COMMENT:Current data suggest that patients with non-small cell lung
 cancer with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons
 18-21) of EGFR may respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
 therapies. Thus, the absence of an EGFR mutation within
 this tumor specimen suggests that these therapies may have
 limited therapeutic value for this patient.
 The predictive value of EGFR testing applies to EGFR
 tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, not to other
 therapeutic agents.
 This result does not rule out the presence of a mutation
 that may be present but below the limits of detection for
 this assay (approximately 5%) or an EGFR mutation that is
 not part of this panel. It is estimated that this panel
 detects greater than 95% of pathogenic mutations (exons
 18-21) associated with response/resistance to EGFR-targeted
 therapies.

The genesis of the absolute ideas about data elements comes from an organization that has big funding but not much success in generating adoption of their approach.
The connection to ISO 11179 is deeply problematic, because the data elements as conceived in FHIR are migratory—like free electron’s  – that is they can exist in many contexts and generally move from a message to a data base when received from an external source. And it can be any arbitrary data base.   But ISO 11179 is intended to define elements in  one specified data base. The data element gets tied to a particular property and object of that data base- and that object and property are defining characteristics of the data element.  (11179 works fine in that context_  But it creates a huge impedance mismatch when you deal with “fee electron” data elements that have no home data base. Creates crazy realities.
Another and deep problem with data elements is the name and the confounding with the use of “data element"" as building blocks of resources. Those are more like data base data elements. The things in questionnaires should have a different name.  In the survey literature they are most commonly called data items.  Using the same name for different things always leads to confusion. 
     From the frame work :
 1.7.1.1 Framework  
FHIR is based on ""Resources"" which are the common building block for all exchanges. Each resource has the following common features: 
• A URL that identifies it
• Common metadata
• A human-readable XHTML summary
• A set of defined common data elements

Additionally, OrderResponse.code is not a good name for its content, and whether the status reflects the status of the response, or the status of the order it responds to. Perhaps OrderResponse.proposedOrderStatus might fit better, but we do not know given current descriptions.

Contsys is a complete and comprehensive system of concepts for healthcare and includes a clinical process model for clinical context. This International standard has been developed during a long period of time and comments from all over the world has contributed to the content, which makes it robust and sustainable.
Contsys aims to become the common basis for global development of semantic resources for interoperability. 
The current work with FHIR resources is not based on this system of concepts. The global efforts for harmonization would much benefit from using Contsys as the basis also for the FHIR resources. 
In comparison the concepts in Contsys is mostly more generic than the FHIR resources. To start with the current FHIR resources could be categorized under the Contsys concepts with possibilities to further alignment later.  Last summer we made a comparision between some Contsys concepts with relevant FHIR resources. We are glad to send the document to you.

Encounter is just one kind of ""context"" that could be needed to state in a resource (see observation.encounter).  Other example that could be needed is clinical process concern, demand for care, main health issue health problem or episode of care.
Create a new element to add, in all resources, and replace ""encounter"" with this in resources there ""encounter"" is used as a context reference. The element should be of different types: Identifier|Reference(Encounter|EpisodeOfCare|ClinicalProcessConcern).

In this case, there's no need to identify the site -- codes are sufficient to convey the location. For example, to express that a measurement was taken from the right index finger or that the left forearm was bruised, certainly the right index finder and left forearm are specific sites, but they needn't be assigned identifiers. 2) The need to identify a body site. For example, identifying a specimen or the specific sites of wounds (when the patient has multiple wounds) or of chest tubes (when the patient has multiple tubes). The body site resource seems to be attempting to solve both needs, whereas it might be better to separate the two needs and use different solutions for each. For need #1, a full resource requiring a patient id is undue complexity.  All that is needed is an inline complex element or data type that contains a CodeableConcept for the ""main"" location plus sub-elements of ""laterality"" and ""relatedness"" (proximal, upper, etc.). (There was a lot of discussion about the correct attributes, and in the end it appears it was just reduced to a single ""modifier"" element, but this is insufficiently exact in its semantics. At least a 0..* name/value pair is needed.) If further detail is needed (e.g., relation to some other body site), another complex type (either a separate type or a generalization of this one) could be constructed.

854,6.5.1   Scope and Usage,Provenance,,http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/provenance.html,Neg-Mj,,,"Provenance resources are a record-keeping assertion that gathers information about the context in which the information in a resource was obtained. Provenance resources are prepared by the application that initiates the create/update etc. of the resource.  

A Audit Event resource contains overlapping information, but is created as events occur, to track and audit the events. Audit Event resources are often (though not exclusively) created by the application responding to the read/query/create/update etc. event. ","A Provenance Resource is a record-keeping assertion applicable to a specific Resource, which conveys contextual information about the Resource to which the Provenance Resource applies.  This contextual information is bound to the Resource so that downstream users can ascertain the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of the Resource.  Senders and receivers should establish policies about their expectations with regard to ensuring the continuity of provenance information is available as applicable to their use cases in accordance with FHIR specifications.  Workgroups with scope encompassing various FHIR Resources are responsible for ensuring that the FHIR Provenance Resource is appropriately bound to their Resources given the requirements of their disciplines and domains, and to provide sufficient guidance to implementers to enable deployment without deep subject matter expertise on this topic.
When an application initiates interactions on a server that manages the state or operations on Resources, the application assigns a Provenance Resource to the target Resource and any previously bound Provenance Resources, which the server persists to enable end users to evaluate the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of that Resource.  The application’s actions are tracked by the application’s AuditEvent component, which must record the application’s behavior that enabled the application user to initiate the actions recorded in the Resource’s Provenance.  Once the interaction is completed, the server’s AuditEvent component must record the server’s behavior, which enabled the persistence of any Provenance Resources assigned to the interaction’s target Resource.","The current Scope and Usage description does not sufficiently specify how to implement the FHIR Provenance Resource in order for it to actually indicate the ""clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle.""   Not only does it not specify the requirements for or the means by which persistence of the provenance but leaves it up to the sender as to whether to send a Provenance Resource along with a transmitted Resource to which it merely points.  This lack of binding leaves the persistence of the provenance entirely up to the receiver.  If the receiver does not retain the provenance, then the FHIR Provenance Resource is not available to end users.  This is concerning given that the FHIR APIs do not prevent updates being made by systems and users who did not author the target Resource.  
In addition, the characterization of the relationship/overlap/dependencies between the AuditEvent and the Provenance Resources are also concerning.  Comments below indicate the lack of a cohesive framework within the AuditEvent and between it and the Provenance Resource for conveying, in a harmonized, comprehensive, and complete manner, the system and user actions that are (1) recorded by Provenance Resource as the sender generates the Resource to which it applies, (2) the AuditEvents that should be recorded in the sender's system about what the sender is generating (which is not mentioned in the description of either Resource), (3) the AuditEvents that should be recorded by the receiver's server pertaining to the requested and actualized behaviors sought by the requester, and (4) the server’s responsibilities with respect to persisting Provenance Resources assigned to the target Resource.
","While acknowledging  the pioneering work that the FHIR Provenance and AuditEvent Resources authors undertook and the foundational importance of that contribution, discussions within the CBCC and Security WGs indicates that the authors and work group participants are aware of the need to refine and further articulate the critical infrastructure specifications of these Resources in FHIR so that this standard can enable the PCAST and JASON reports vision of atomic clinical relevant information structures that are persistently associated with both privacy [and its enforcing security] and provenance metadata.

5) AuditEventObjectLifecycle: Identifier for the data life-cycle stage for the object",,"The disparate list of value sets required by the AuditEvent for specifying the action or “event”, neither of which is cleanly delineated, need to be harmonized after analyzed for completeness and consistency, and suitability for purpose.
The AuditEvent Resource [/auditevent.html] has three REQUIRED value sets with which to value AuditEvent action related elements in addition to other IDs, and the FHIR Provenance Entity.role that conflict, overlap, are not coordinated, and are likely incomplete. 
Some are very detailed, workflow, discipline, or system interaction specific and others are very high level.  The value set ""AuditEventAction"" [/audit-event-action.html] is so coarse grained and generic that it's likely that the other value sets could be subsumed under one of its CRUDE codes.  
The AuditEvent Resource has two elements in addition to the action element, the AuditEventType [Type/identifier of event - /valueset-audit-event-type.html] and the AuditEventSubType [More specific type/id for the event -  /valueset-audit-event-sub-type.html] , but it’s not entirely clear why one value set is considered an “action” and two other value sets are considered “types”. This type and subtype combination appear to be DICOM specific system actions stated in the past tense.  Some of the types clearly coordinate with related subtypes [Application Activity type could be subtyped by Application Start], but a number of them don't unless the majority of subtypes are events that raise the Security Alert Type.  
Several Audit Event Types are for CRUD on granular objects, e.g., Order [Audit event: Order has been created, read, updated or deleted], Patient Record [Audit event: Patient Record has been created, read, updated, or deleted], and Procedure Record [Audit event: Patient Record has been created, read, updated, or deleted].   
There's no description about how these are to be coordinated with any subtype audit events, why these are the only objects included in this list of audit events [although one could surmise that these were the focus of the DICOM community when developing the list of relevant audit events in their discipline], and how these are to be coordinated with e.g.:
• The audit event subtype restful-interaction “history-instance: Retrieve the update history for a particular resource” and “history-type: Retrieve the update history for a particular resource, type of resource, or the entire system”, 
• The 2.2.0.1 FHIR defined Operations “Fetch Patient Record” or “Fetch Encounter Record”
• ""AuditEventAction"" Update data such as Revise Patient Information.
• AuditEventObjectLifecycle Access/Use [/object-lifecycle.html].
In addition, elsewhere in the FHIR DSTU there are lists of FHIR defined Operations [/operations.html 2.2.01] RPC-like operations in addition to the Restful-Interactions listed as AuditEventSubtype values [bottom of restful-interaction /valueset-restful-interaction.html] that are arguably auditable actions/events.
This is not an exhaustive review of redundancy/overlap/gaps related to AuditEvent and Provenance Resource action related elements and value sets.
","At this juncture, it’s not clear how this potpourri of audit event types/actions are supposed to work together to achieve an interoperable approach to addressing 45 CFR 170 Meaningful Use Certification Criteria, 2015 § 170.210 Standards for health information technology to protect electronic health information created, maintained, and exchanged (e) Record actions related to electronic health information, audit log status, and encryption of end-user devices.

Nor is it clear how the plethora of audit event on the server are supposed to inform the Provenance Resource on the client as to what auditable actions of provenance relevance were performed. Despite assurances that there is coordination and some overlap between the capture of actions on Resources in the FHIR Provenance and FHIR AuditEvent, it is not clear how four Entity-Role codes on the Provenance Resource [derivation, revision, quotation, and source] map to any of the multiple codes in the AuditEvent.

",,"The claims that the FHIR Provenance Resource is ""based on the W3C Provenance specification"" with mappings seems to be an overstatement. [See /provenance-mappings.html] 

RE: Entity.role  - The FHIR Provenance.entity.role, which is defined as “How the entity was used during the activity” is incorrectly mapped to W3C PROV state changes Derivation and Revision, which are defined as “connections between entities” [http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-primer-20130430/#derivation-and-revision-1] rather than to W3C PROV Entity Roles, which are defined as “role is the function of an entity or agent with respect to an activity, in the context of a usage, generation, invalidation, association, start, and end.” [http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/#term-attribute-role and http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Role]

RE: Provenance Resource/Activity - The FHIR Provenance Resource [aka Activity] does not properly or completely map to W3C PROV Activity.  While the FHIR Provenance Resource documentation indicates that there is some named activity or process being conveyed, there is none.  From the perspective of W3C model, which is included in the FHIR Provenance Resource Background and Context [6.5.3], W3C is a ""3 legged stool"" but the FHIR Provenance Resource is missing the Activity leg.

The Provenance Resource is mapped to the Control Act class in HL7 v.3, which is defined as “An act representing a system action such as the change of state of another act or the initiation of a query. All control acts represent trigger events in the HL7 context. ControlActs may occur in different moods” and to “Activity” in W3C PROV, where it is defined as “An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.”[http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-xml-20130430/]  Difficulty is that FHIR Provenance does not include an element comparable to the ControlActEvent Act.code by which to specify the actual activity that brought the target Resource to its current state, such as the trigger events for create and replace used in v.3 Document Management Topic. Instead, the FHIR Provenance Resource defaults out-of-band of the resource to always being a “generates”:  “The Provenance resource actually corresponds to a single activity that identifies a set of resources (target) generated by the activity.” [6.5.3 Background].  However, generation of a Resource used in this manner to mean “any activity” that led to its genesis, is far too generic to be useful as provenance.  Recommend adding an Activity element to capture the workflow (e.g., as in HL7 trigger event, Act.Status, DocumentCompletion or EHR Lifecycle events, and de-couple it from the ""acts/events"" captured by the AuditEvent, which in are only system reflections of the activity of agents on healthcare information objects.","The DSTU states that ""The Provenance resource is tailored to fit the FHIR use-cases for provenance more directly"".  That use case should be more clearly articulated so that the current version makes more sense.  Recommendation is to either model the FHIR Provenance Resource directly out of W3C, use W3C PROV xml rather than a FHIR Provenance, or clearly model the FHIR Provenance Resource as the FHIR version of a ControlAct used to convey the trigger event leading to the interaction or the trigger events that impact a Resource in its lifecycle, which may be conveyed in an interaction.

",,"[I may have totally misunderstood how the following FHIR capabilities are meant to work together, but this is the only sense I can make of the write up - so either I need more education on this and there needs to be better documentation or there's something fundamentally broken in the design, which wouldn't be that hard to fix.] AuditEvents are about actions performed on the server, which were initiated by an application, which may send Provenance about the context on the application side of a Resource that the application has uploaded, updated, executed, or deleted on the server.  The FHIR Provenance Resource at this juncture has no element to convey the Resource's life span on the application or the specific lifecycle event that triggered the application to upload, update, execute or delete it on the server.  According to the AuditEvent, all the details about what happened to the Resource are about actions on the server side, not on the application side, so that audit log isn't informative about what happened to the Resource on the application side.  Perhaps the application that prepares the Provenance Resource to send along with the target Resource could also send along a snippet of the target Resource's audit log in order to inform downstream users about the actions performed on the Resource on the application side.  But that means that the application has to be smart enough to determine what part of the audit log is relevant to the Provenance Resource being prepared to accompany the target Resource.  Taking this approach means that the sender has to send along two optional Resources along with the target Resource, and there's no guarantee that the receiving server is going to persist them together.  

Recommended fixes - Add an action element with binding to the ProvenanceEventCurrentState vocabulary [which is awaiting updating by the Security and EHR workgroup for appropriate workflow trigger events], add a pointer to the Provenance Resources to all entities involved in the generation of the target Resource, and add Lifecycle event to the Provenance Resource.

Requirements 
Use of the Health Care Privacy/Security Classification (HCS) system of security-tag use is recommended.
 
 The confidentiality codes can carry multiple vocabulary items. HL7 has developed an understanding of security and privacy tags that might be desirable in a Document Sharing environment, called HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS). The following specification is recommended but not mandated, as the vocabulary bindings are an administrative domain responsibility. The use of this method is up to the policy domain such as the XDS Affinity Domain or other Trust Domain where all parties including sender and recipients are trusted to appropriately tag and enforce. • [1…1] Confidentiality Security Classification Label Field • [0…] Sensitivity Security Category Label Field • [0…] Compartment Security Category Label Field • [0…] Integrity Security Category Label Field • [0…] Handling Caveat Security Category Field In the HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System In the HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification (HCS) there are code systems specific to Confidentiality, Sensitivity, Integrity, and Handling Caveats. Some values would come from a local vocabulary as they are related to workflow roles and special projects.","Requirements - Use of the Health Care Privacy/Security Classification System (HCS) Security Classification Label is required and must be the same code that is required to be used on the header of the CDA Document being referenced.  The Confidentiality codes that value the Security Classification Label are the complete hierarchical set of security classification levels ranging from the lowest non-classified level to the most classified level.  These levels indicate the clearance or level of the ""need to know"" that an authorized requester must have in order to access this information.  
Comments - Confidentiality codes convey security classifications used to permit or restrict access without revealing the specific sensitivities of the referenced document or other artifact.  No other Security Labels should be used in this context including the Sensitivity, Compartment, Integrity, Handling Caveat Categories or the Privacy Policy codes as these reveal the security clearance attributes that a requester must be able to claim or they indicate the sensitivity of information that only authorized user are permitted to access.  

Once access is granted to the reference document/artifact, an authorized user can access the other Security Labels used to convey governing privacy policies, information sensitivity, integrity of the information, and handling instructions such as permissible purposes of use, and any obligations or refrain policies with which the user must comply.

MITRE's recommendation is to completely change the way profiles are specified: You should be able to put your profiles into an integrated development environment like Eclipse and manage your profiles development as a project. The base resources and extensions should be brought in as fixed libraries. There should be a file hierarchy that groups similar files, e.g., /extensions, /valuesets, /profile-diffs, /examples. You should be able to use a normal text editor. The profile-diffs should be defined using the simplest possible declarations. The “build” should simply create the profile XML from the project files, and putting the result in /profiles. It should be local and self-contained.

1117,,,,Profiling,Neg-Mj,,,,,"It is common that resource references should be constrained such that they resolve to a profiled resource, rather than a base resource. For example, in the US realm, wherever there is a reference to Patient, that reference should be restricted to a DAF-Patient. So any resource that references Patient will need to be profiled, to impose this restriction. For example, we have to profile NutritionOrder, whether that was in the original scope or not. Now, since ClinicalImpression refers to NutritionOrder, and we don't want to point to the unprofiled version of NutritionOrder, we have to create a profile of ClinicalImpression that restricts the reference to NutritionOrder to our new profiled version. And so on, and so on. Considering the entire network of relationships between resources in FHIR, profile developers end up having to profile most or all resources (the only exception being loosely connected or unconnected ""islands"" such as the billing and payment resources. Strictly speaking, any reference to ""Any"" immediately entails profiling every resource.) 

The fan-out problem implies creating a great many profiles (a network covering set), and changing all the resource references in those profiles. With the current tooling, this is an imposing task.

http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/encounter-daf.html#5.18.12.2",Neg-Mi,,,"A patient encounter is further characterized by the setting in which it takes place. Amongst them are ambulatory, emergency, home health, inpatient and virtual encounters. An Encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters). During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location. 

Because of the broad scope of Encounter, not all elements will be relevant in all settings. For this reason, admission/discharge related information is kept in a separate Hospitalization component within Encounter. The class element is used to distinguish between these settings, which will guide further validation and application of business rules. 

There is also substantial variance from organization to organization (and between jurisdictions and countries) on which business events translate to the start of a new Encounter, or what level of aggregation is used for Encounter. For example, each single visit of a practitioner during a hospitalization may lead to a new instance of Encounter, but depending on local practice and the systems involved, it may well be that this is aggregated to a single instance for a whole hospitalization. Even more aggregation may occur where jurisdictions introduce groups of Encounters for financial or other reasons. Encounters can be aggregated or grouped under other Encounters using the partOf element. See below for examples. 

Encounter instances may exist before the actual encounter takes place to convey pre-admission information, including using Encounters elements to reflect the planned start date or planned encounter locations. In this case the status element is set to 'planned'. 

The Hospitalization component is intended to store the extended information relating to a hospitalization event. This is always expected to be the same period as the encounter itself, where this is different then another encounter is entered which captures this information which is a partOf this encounter instance
",Add Encounter.hospitalization.period,"In DSTU1, there was an Encounter.hospitalization.period that was removed in DSTU2.  The Encounter.period is not sufficient since an encounter could start in the emergency department and then progress into a hospitalization.  Having a single Encounter.period doesn't indicate both the arrival date (in the ED) and also the date when the actual admission to inpatient took place.

The scope section is contradictory when it acknowledges ""There is also substantial variance from organization to organization (and between jurisdictions and countries) on which business events translate to the start of a new Encounter, or what level of aggregation is used for Encounter.  For example, each single visit of a practitioner during a hospitalization may lead to a new instance of Encounter, but depending on local practice and the systems involved, it may well be that this is aggregated to a single instance for a whole hospitalization"" yet then follows by saying ""The Hospitalization component is intended to store the extended information relating to a hospitalization event. This is always expected to be the same period as the encounter itself, where this is different then another encounter is entered which captures this information which is a partOf this encounter instance.""

One option is to make the observation classification a first class element that is populated explicitly by the source system whereas another option would be a FHIR-defined value set that defines the scope of which codes universally represent the top 200 labs (for example).

The reasonNotGiven is most relevant for inpatient (medicationadministration) medications, which supports the scope of the MedicationStatement including inpatient (administered) medications.  However, the EMR is generally only asking the patient about compliance (wasNotGiven) for outpatient/home prescriptions due to the lack of visibility to patient compliance with those home medications.  In the inpatient setting, when clinicians are administering medications, there is no need to ask the patient for their compliance statement (since the medication administration record serves as evidence that the medication was given).  Thus, many inpatient (administered) medications won't have an explicit informationSource and dateAsserted, but rather inpatient orders will have an actual medicationprescription and corresponding medicationadministrations.  The scope implies the MedicationStatement resource is intended to cover inpatient medication orders that were administered by the provider, which means there is some ambiguity in the informationSource and dateAsserted.  EMRs will track the medicationprescription and medicationadministration, but do EMRs generally document compliance beyond that?

1356,4.20.19,Observation,,http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/observation-genetics-cg-prf-1a.html,Neg-Mi,,,(Entire page contents),To provide this the resolution team would have to first consider the idea of developing a Profile that contained extensions to the Observation that would permit the use of Observation sets to delineate between the major types of observations performed by genetic testing labs during the multi-step testing processes that they provide.  See comments for further explanation.,"There are testing centers that run genotyping or sequencing tests to simply identify the presence or absence of a given genotype in specific patient tissue (germline, tumor , prenatal) as well as in viral or bacterial organisms found within a patient.  There are also labs that perform interpretive services on the findings produced by wet lab and bioinformatic processes.  The interpretive services are not always included but can be performed as a secondary service at the lab identifying the genotypes or by a secondary lab that specializes in one or more clinical domain areas or even by the receiving clinician/provider that ordered the test (the treating physician).  So, it seems that we would want to define LOINC panels that group logical sets of observations together for the separate types of observations, then use an approach similar to how the Example shown for DiagnosticReport ""Lipid Report"" using LOINC panels to profile the constraints around providing a set of Observations that comprise a logical observations that are included with every Lipid Panel.  This concept and proper use of Profiling should be understood by the authors of the Genetics group before proceeding with an approach that simply adds a dozen or more attributes (as well intentioned as they may be) to a single Observation Resource.  I strongly recommend a review of these proper uses of Profile extensions using LOINC codes and panels, as that has historically been an important aspect of Laboratory results reporting.  With the current model there is no standard way to associate LOINC observation codes to these new set of geneticsXXX attributes.  Hardcoding or mapping is unreasonable.
     I suggest the following presentation for a quick helpful picture of how LOINC panels are used to constrain a Profile http://www.slideshare.net/ewoutkramer/authoring-fhir-profiles-extended-version starting at slide 41.  In actuality, the entire presentation is useful for understanding how and what is needed to be considered when developing a Profile.  Summary: 1) Demonstrate pragmatic examples of how profiles can be developed in FHIR, particularly around the use of LOINC codes and panels to develop Observation sets. 2) Ask the authors to identify the major workflow/service patterns performed by genetic testing labs (not super detailed). I believe they will see that there is a logical and useful separation of wet lab, variant identification/calling services from the clinical analytics/interpretation services. 3) develop the sets of observed values for the components in each phase.  For example, GenotypeObservation in the first phase with a presence or absence interpretation.  And, possibly, GeneticInterpretationObservation with the targeted set of phenotypes (germline, cancer, condition, pharmacogentic, etc) and the clinical significance as asserted by an expert geneticist.  4) With a logical grouping of the observation sets, I believe it will provide the health care community the opportunity to build up representations of complex genotypes and alleles, when needed in pharmacogentic reporting, as well as structure variants, somatic interpretation, and other state specific use cases yet to be standardized.","Example workflow, values, and grouping",,,,Cgen,,,,,,,,,,,,Perry Mar ,,Larry Babb ,lbabb@partners.org,3,

It then mentions ""cancer genome"", which suggests either association with specific diseases or tissue source in terms of tumor cell, etc. type, both of which are inconsistent with all of the three previously suggested ideas (note that some genomic variants in a cancer cell could have been inherited and some variants could have arisen from somatic mutations).

Other profiles that represent specific use cases will no doubt reuse these extensions, but in specialized formats (e.g., histoimmunogenetics), and new extensions defined for those use cases. Separate resources/extensions that specifically define sequences and variants of those sequences will need to be created, that include metadata such as coordinate systems (0- or 1-based, and open and/or closed), which differ depending on use cases. Even in this single use case, the coordinate system is not defined which turns understanding the genomicstart and genomicstop coordinates into making trying to make an educated decision (e.g., default to whatever HGVS or VCF is using, or what BED, UCSC internal formats and Genomic Alliance standards are being used).",,,,,Cgen,,,,,,,,,,,,Bob Milius,,,,1,

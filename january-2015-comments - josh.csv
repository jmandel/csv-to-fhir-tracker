If this isn't acceptable, then the value set for refusal reason should include only refusal reasons, not other types of exemptions.

A related issue is that there are no invariants that prevent (e.g.) having a refusal reason when the vaccine wasn't refused, or documenting an adverse reaction when the vaccine was not administered.

If the element is status, then there might be several status values that are not modifying (e.g. active, completed, in progress) and some that are (e.g. entered in error, cancelled). Instead of labeling the element as a modifier, that modifier label should be applied to values. That way, the receiver can quickly scan a resource and know if the meaning is actually being modified, even if the receiver does not understand the nature of the specific modification.

1,FHIR Core,,6.21,,,,Questionnaire,,http://hl7.org/fhir/2015May/valueset.html,Neg-Mj,Clarification,,,,,"General problem
Can answer lists (a special kind of value set) exist without connection to a question that needs that answer list? And vice versa for catagorical answer lists?  We struggeled at NLM to know when two value sets defined for MU rules were the same because they were not anchored to a field or a question.
On the other side, it is difficult to try to figure out what a field is for if the answer list is not carried with it.  The answer list (or example answer list) anchors them. So should ask the question if answer list and question (variables) are not tied together like horse and carriage, love and marriage?",Can answer lists be independent of questions?,Yes,,,"Proposed Disposition: Not Persuasive with Mod 
Answer lists (ValueSets) can be tied to a wide variety of elements - including questionnaire questions.  It is perfectly possible for a ValueSet to be re-used by multiple questions within a single Questionnaire or across Questionnaires.  It is also possible for ValueSets to be shared by Questionnaire questions, DataElements, StructureDefinition elements, etc.  There will certainly be circumstances where a given ValueSet is intrinsically tied to a single Questionnaire, in which case it can be sent as a ""contained"" resource.

We will add documentation to Questionnaire explaining the potential for ValueSet re-use as well as appropriate behavior when ValueSet s need to be strictly tied to Questionnaires",PC,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clement J. McDonald,NLM,,clemmcdonald@mail.nih.gov,1,,,,,

Think about it. The combinatorial explosion happens rapidly.  We have to find busines rules that would constrain what we allow e.g. alow arbitrary addition of some flavors of null but not others.  The argument is made that every instirution will want to add its own codes ( a different coding system).  Maybe, but then why are we pretending to be pushing for interoperability? We won't have it.",Multi-code system value sets are bad,Yes,,,"Proposed Disposition: Not Persuasive.
Multiple code systems do not necessarily impeed interoperability.  Interoperability is only challenged when different code systems are used by different code systems.  Most code systems have clearly defined purposes, however codes from them may be used for other purposes.  For example, NDC codes identify specific drug products as they are manufactured.  This works well for dispensing and is sometimes appropriate for prescribing.  However, prescribing sometimes also requires more generic codes that aren't specific to manufacturer or possibly even form.  Without mixing code systems (e.g. RxNorm, SNOMED CT), it wouldn't be possible to define a complete value set for the needed purpose.",Vocab,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clement J.

13,FHIR Core,,General,,,,,(many),,Neg-Mj,Clarification,,,,,"not at all clear which of these are  master files (Knowledge bases) versus patient specific data. The distinction should be asserted in the description.  The medications resource makes it clear that it is a knowledge base, not patient specific entity. (Labs and tests and nursing orders need the same kind of master file. (And don't think it's a data element anymore than medications are) 
Contra-indications strike me as something that is also a master file and applies in general not something that is specific to the patient. 
 needs clarification
Clinical impression as a resource is problematic and should be removed. Its only clear use is as one section of a SOAP problem oriented note. It is not an independent entity. Any more than the 3-4 parts of radiologist reports (Reason for study, findings, impresson) are.  Further lab tests routinely include an summative element that is labeled an impression or interpretation, and it is just another observation. If readers of this standard believe they all have to be impression resources it wiil add complexity with no utility. ~~
Risk assessment is a new invention in the sense of being a separate thing. Suspect it does not deserve its own separate resource and will create lots of work for people trying to decide what goes where.   Some lab tests, e.g prenatal screening report values that are literally risk, as does the Framingham risk equation. There is no reason to distinguish these structurally from ""bread and butter"" observations; they could be culled out when/if needed by looking at the master file.

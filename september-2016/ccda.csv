Accurate Birth sex is critical for laboratory result reporting and in V2  and V3 should be reported as a clinical observation.  PID-8 was originally (up until V2.4) titled ""Sex"" but the field  title was clarified for harmonization when HL7 Version 3 differentiated the concepts of ""administrative gender"" defined as ""The gender of a person used for administrative purposes (as opposed to clinical gender)"" thus creating two distinct concepts.   

Suggest working with Patient Administration to determine whether it is possible to clarify the definition of V2 PID-8 to include Birth Sex, but since V2 is normative and per ANSI, has to be backward compatible this may not be possible.  

Another alternative is to add a new field to the V2 PID segment to capture Birth Sex. ",Birth sex,,,,,Structured Documents,,,,,,,,,,,,,Freida Hall ,Quest Diagnostics ,Freida Hall ,freida.x.hall@questdiagnostics.com ,,,,,,

The implementation guide is presented as profiles on the Composition resource. I donÂ’t think this does justice to the strengths of both standards - CDA and FHIR. Instead of attempting to recreate a C-CDA document as a set of compositions, the implementation guide would be much more useful addressing two actual use cases: 
? when a C-CDA needs to be generated based on existing, possibly distributed data available in the form of FHIR resources
? when data from existing C-CDA content needs to be presented to consumer of FHIR resources
Proposed ballot content
As the ballot already mentions, some of the work of representing C-CDA information as FHIR resources is already done as part of the DAF profiles. This implementation guide should illustrate the above-mentioned use cases with this existing content, and develop anything missing. The focus should be on the amount of data from using Â“vanillaÂ” FHIR resources that can be represented or used for building a C-CDA document, and highlight any extensions necessary. This will also allow for the identifications of any gaps regarding the implementation of each of the base standards, FHIR and C-CDA.

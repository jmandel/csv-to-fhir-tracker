It sounds though that DAF-Research is meant to be built on DAF-Core.  However, when that happens, DAF-Core would contain more than needed for CCDS in 2015 Cert Edition.  So either the scope of DAF-Research needs to be clarified that it pulls from multiple sources, or if indeed DAF-Core is meant to be the only source, then DAF-Core needs to be split into DAF-Core and DAF-CCDS.
See comment in other ballot that given DAF-Core's scope, it really should be called DAF-CCDS.
Another example would be Device where CCDS would be more restrictive (implementable devices) than DAF-Research would likely be interested in, further questioning the relationship and naming between these IGs.",Review DAF Core to DAF research,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hans Buitendijk ,Cerner ,Hans Buitendijk ,,,,,,,

1,FluentPath,,,,,,,index,http://www.hl7.org/fluentpath/2016Sept/index.html,NEG,Clarification,,,"Neutral Mapping Notation

""FluentPath is a path based navigation and extraction language, somewhat like XPath. Operations are expressed in terms of the logical content of hierarchical data models, and support traversal, selection and filtering of data. Its design was influenced by the needs for path navigation, selection and formulation of invariants in both HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and HL7 Clinical Quality Language (CQL).""",FluentPath or FHIRPath,"First of all, this is great work so I would normally not vote negative. However, I would strongly recommend changing the name from Neutral Mapping Notation to the actual name on the specification - FluentPath or FHIRPath. Unfortunately, the current name seems to indicating a mapping language which FluentPath is not and is misleading. While it is true that FluentPath can be leveraged in a mapping language to specify nodes in a tree, it is not a mapping language from what I can tell. I added it to my review list thinking it was one thing and found out it was really something else (though equally important).",Change the name,,A,,,ITS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Claude Nanjo ,Cognitive Medical Systems ,Claude Nanjo ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This title does not accurately reflect the changes since the proposals are to eliminate some existing CQL Operators.  Regardless, I am concerned that while these new operators are valid, they will not be friendly in the human-readable Measure display.  We have to remember that while FHIR is basically being designed for computer interaction, there will be end-users such as measure developers, clinical decision support developers, and quality staff that need to be able to read FHIR documents (e.g., MeasureReport).  These staff will most likely be clinicians, statisticians, business analysts, and/or data analysts that will not have a technical and/or mathematically background to help them understand what they are seeing in their browser.  It cannot be expected that every provider, measure developer, CDS developer, etc develop an application to display a document (especially if CMS posts it on their eCQM Library webpage).

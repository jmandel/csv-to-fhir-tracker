7,QI Core,,,,,,,(profiles),,NEG,Enhancement,,,,,"In the previous FHIR build process, when the FHIR source spreadsheet were processed, extension definitions at the resource or global levels were generated as separate structure definition files prefixed with the name 'extension-' (e.g., extension-patient-clinicaltrial.xml) and file names followed a clear name convention. Such conventions made it easy for tooling to use file filters to quickly identify extensions and process them accordingly. Now, the new tooling prefixes all the files with 'StructureDefinition-'. These filename thus no longer distinguish between extensions and other structure definitions forcing tooling to open the files, parse them, and check the type of structuredefinition first. I would like to suggest a naming convention such as the current one for the FHIR build tool that clearly distinguishes the type of structure definition in the file name.",Extension naming differences due to IG build process,Yes,B,,,Clinical Quality Information,,,,,,,,,,,,,Claude Nanjo ,Cognitive Medical Systems ,Claude Nanjo ,,,,,,,

Yet, the full definition reappears inline in the QICore patient profile even though the patient.nationality extension in QICorePatient references the URL of the FHIR Core Patient Nationality extension definition. Given that both extension definitions are identical, such duplication is both redundant and incorrect. Rather the following two options are preferred: 
1. Simply reference the FHIR Core extension but don't redefine it inline in the QICore profile for the resource.
2. Re-include the FHIR Core extension as a separate file if the intent is to have all definitions in one package for distribution. Be sure to name the file and its URI the same way as it is done in the FHIR Core specification.

","Definition: This value set includes concept codes for specific substances/pharmaceutical products, allergy or intolerance conditions, and negation/exclusion codes to specify the absence of specific types of allergies or intolerances to specific substances/pharmaceutical products.","In Quality Measures, RxNorm codes are currently used to represent the actual medications which were not done due to an allergy.

The wording ""This value set includes concept codes for specific substances/pharmaceutical products"" implies to us that this value set includes the actual medications using SNOMED CT and not just the codes to be used for "" allergy or intolerance conditions, and negation/exclusion codes"".  

We are concerned that implementers may become confused and think they need to map medications to SNOMED in addition to RxNorm.

Examples of individuals that will be required to use FHIR documentation other than technical implementers include quality measure developers, clinical decision support developers, and quality improvement staff.  Typically these individuals are clinicians, statisticians, business analysts and/or data analysts whose companies may not see the benefit of paying for them to attend HL7 training (they'll send IT or expect their vendor to know it and not understand why their clinical/business staff needs to understand).

Identify the different type of job roles that will need to use the FHIR documentation and then determine/implement tools to assist them in understanding how to use the documentation.  Also, review the current format and link types to determine if there is a different way that would make it easier for non-IT staff to understand.",Make spec easier to navigate for different user types,Yes,F,,,Clinical Quality Information,,,,,,,,,,,,,Patty Craig ,pcraig@jointcommission.org ,Lisa Anderson ,LAnderson2@jointcommission.org ,,,,,,

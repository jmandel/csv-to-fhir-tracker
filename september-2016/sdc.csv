The driver of this workflow is the Form Filler system. It retrieves a form (Questionnaire) from the Form Manager. It may also request that the Form Manager generate an initial QuestionnaireResponse, potentially partially populated with information known by the Form Manager or supplied by the Form Filler. The Form Filler could generate the QuestionnaireResponse itself without the assistance of the Form Manager and in either case could partially fill in the response based on information known by the form filler. When as much of the questionnaire response as possible has been filled in by automated means, the form is displayed to an end-user who reviews and edits the automatically populated content as well as completing those portions of the form that were not populated automatically....The pre-population process (done by the Form Manager) and the auto-population process (done by the Form Filler itself) can be done by a variety of means..",,"While the text describes the SDC workflow from a FHIR perspective, the schematic does not portray a generic SDC workflow and does not match the description of roles in the SDC and IHE-SDC profiles.  Request from system is for an instance of a form/questionnaire, not a questionaire response.  Questionaire.response is only generated when data provided associated with instance of form, whether in optional pre-pop workflow (completed in IHE profile by role ""Form Processor"", a role that is distinct from that of Form Manager) or by the EHR system/Form Filler.  Maintaining a distinction between the Form Manager (entities that cannot/will not handle PII) and Form Processor seems critical due to the different security and confidentiality requirements for the two roles.

There is nothing which specifies to whom a Receiver may look - the QuestionnaireResponse may reference Filler's identifier for the Form but the Filler may not expose a server/query for that Questionnaire.
